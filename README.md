# PacMan-Clone
#####A clone of the well known game for a group assignment

Please Try to keep the master branch with working code. If you want to test something, use your dev branch. It is your responsibility to keep your branch up to date with the master.

One final rule: you break it, you ~~buy~~ bebug it, hope you know GDB! :trollface:

We are using travis as our contious intergation server, it will (attempt to) build every branch in this repo. View the CI builds here: https://travis-ci.org/lupus590/PacMan-Clone/builds

Until I can setup visual studio to do the debugging we will have to use this: http://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf

If you want/need to debug then use GDB (see above link) or use QT creator for a gui: https://www.qt.io/download/
